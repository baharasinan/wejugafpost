Hollywood’s biggest stars got together in Los Angeles on Sunday, Feb. 22, staging a class reunion in honor of the 87th Annual Academy Awards.&nbsp;</p><p>Hosted by <strong><a href=#>Neil Patrick Harris</a></strong> at Los Angeles’ Dolby Theatre, the Oscars honored Birdman, <strong>Eddie Redmayne</strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Julianne Moore</a></strong> with the Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Actress awards, respectively. When they weren’t clapping for their colleagues and accepting awards, however, famous faces got together for drinks, merriment, and entertaining encounters. Below, all the juicy moments you didn’t see on the television broadcast!</p><p><strong><a href=#>Jared Leto</a>‘s Social Hour</strong><br>After taking home the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club at the 2014 Oscars, Leto used the 2015 ceremony to have a little fun. Eyewitnesses tell <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> that the performer “jumped up at every commercial and was talking to everyone,” specifically seeking out <strong>Bruce Dern</strong> to say hello.<br>At one point, Leto’s mingling led to a bit of confusion about his seat. He saw a seatfiller in his assigned seat, exclaiming “Oh s–t!” when he saw it was occupied. He also found himself in a different seat at one point, as he couldn’t make it back to his spot in time when the show resumed from a break.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a>, Woman of the People</strong><br>The Lucy actress was quite the personable personality at the Oscars. Just Like Us, she waited patiently in line for the bathroom, choosing not to use her star-power to push through to the front of the line. Instead, she sipped champagne as she waited, chatting with <strong>Cheryl Hines</strong> and a female friend who exited the restroom and complimented Johansson on her dress.<br>Later, she spoke about her new baby <strong>Rose</strong>, gushing about the little girl and her own experience with motherhood. As she spoke about the 6-month-old, the man to whom she was speaking stepped on her dress, but she was too polite to say anything.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong><a href=#>Anna Wintour</a> Holds Court</strong><br>The imperious, sunglasses-clad Vogue Editor-in-Chief popped into the Dolby Lounge, meeting up with <strong><a href=#>Cate Blanchett</a></strong>, who was the first celeb to snag a drink at the lounge’s bar. The two style stars chatted and caught up, with Blanchett admiring Wintour’s high-fashion getup. After complimenting the iconic editor’s fur shrug, the actress gushed, “Ooooh we are such fashionable ladies!”<br>While the Monuments Men beauty downed cocktails, Wintour sipped on water. “I’ve had one drink, I’ve had one drink,” Blanchett joked, inspiring a fit of laughter from her pal. When she wasn’t speaking to Blanchett, Wintour offered a quick wave to an excited <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong><a href=#>Sienna Miller</a>‘s Date With Dad</strong><br>The American Sniper actress spent time with her father <strong>Edwin Miller</strong> at the Dolby Lounge, ordering glasses of champagne for herself and her dad before canceling his glass upon his refusal. As the two embraced and chatted, Miller showed her papa a selfie that she took with her director <strong>Clint Eastwood</strong>.<br>She later held her dad’s hand as they walked out of the lounge, and took a moment to introduce him to <strong><a href=#>Keira Knightley</a></strong>, referring to him as “Daddy.” Miller admired fellow Brit Knightley’s baby bump, stroking her stomach and exclaiming, “I love this bump!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> Charms As <a href=#>Justin Theroux</a> Chugs</strong><br>Snubbed by the Academy for her performance in Cake, Aniston chose not to drown her sorrows in cocktails. Offered a drink, she laughed and politely responded, “If I start, I will not stop, so I have to say no.” Instead, she honored the request of a little girl who asked for a picture with her, leaving the young woman beaming.<br>Her fiancé Theroux did not go the same route, opting for a heavy Ketel One drink, poured in a wine glass with extra limes. He downed his drink with a straw and chatted with various behind-the-scenes production people as his lady caught Wintour’s eye. Aniston then jetted off to the bathroom with a pal, slipping into the stall with her female friend.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong><a href=#>Lady Gaga</a>‘s Support System</strong><br>The pop singer, who stunned with her Sound of Music tribute performance, was “so sweet” with her parents <strong>Cindy</strong> and <strong>Joe Germanotta</strong>, insiders tell Us. The New Yorkers were “so proud” of their daughter as they took in her talked-about renditions of <strong>Julie Andrews</strong>‘ famed songs.<br>When she got up to take the microphone, Lady Gaga left her mom and dad with <strong>will.i.am</strong>, telling the Black Eyed Peas alum, “Now you can hang with my parents.” He spent time with Mama and Papa Gaga as they nervously anticipated their daughter’s big gig.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong><a href=#>Emma Stone</a> Gets a Consolation Prize</strong><br>The Birdman actress nabbed one of the coveted Lego Oscar trophies during <strong>Tegan and Sara</strong>‘s fittingly awesome “Everything Is Awesome” performance. Sources tell Us that she carried it throughout the night, even bringing the toy to the Governors Ball, where she joked, “No one is gonna know. I’m going to carry it all night and people are going to be like ‘Congratulations!'”<br>Her wish came true as she received humorous well-wishes in an escalator. “Thank you so much!” she told her supporters. “I’d like to thank all the people! I’m never giving this up.” At one point she motioned the statue toward fellow nominee <strong>Benedict Cumberbatch</strong>, commiserating on their mutual losses.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOqKqcmaKoenN8kG5ksKCRqXq6u9Rmm6Kcnql6tLHEZqGaqpWZeq2x06hko62jqbavedOhnKunpa16qLHTZpuor55if3F9lGtqaw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./place-for-a-bird-to-roost-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Place for a bird to roost">&larr;
