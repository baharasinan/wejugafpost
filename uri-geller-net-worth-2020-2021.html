As an adult, Geller joined the Israeli army in the Paratroopers Bridge, where he served in the six-day war of 1967. He also worked as a photographic model in 1968 and 1969 when he became popular for small audiences ion nightclubs.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>In 1979, he married Hanna Geller. They have two children,- Natalie and Daniel. It is said that pop singer Michael Jackson was the best company at the duo’s wedding and since then they had a famous friendship. In the 1970s, Geller called himself as a genuine psychic rather than a stage magician or entertainer.</p><p>His psychic abilities granted by the extraterrestrials made him a topic or genre of widespread criticism. Throughout his career, he used his psychic abilities to predict the fate of sports or games. His record of incorrect predictions described his endorsement as the curse of Uri Geller by a fan of skeptic James Randi.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 20 December 1946, Uri Geller is 77 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024.

He was well known for his spoon bending tactics, hidden drawings, and mysterious tricks. He claimed that he achieved all of these through telekinesis and psychic abilities. A scientific experiment was conducted in 1974 by the Stanford Research Institute, where they found authenticity in Geller’s skills and called it the “Geller effect.”</p><p>In 2007, Geller hosted an Israeli reality TV show called “The Successor,” which insisted on finding people with supernatural powers. In the same year, he was signed by NBC to host the show “Phenomenon” with another illusionist Criss Angel, where they looked for the next great mentalist.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>The Berglas Foundation Honored Geller with the “ Services to the promotion of Magic Award” for his contribution to spreading magic and tricks among the masses.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Uri Geller&nbsp;in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Uri-Geller-Net-Worth.jpg><p>Being a television personality, he has been very successful after hosting several TV shows.
