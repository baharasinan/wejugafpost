He has posted several pictures of his lover on his Instagram account.</p><p>However, it is essential to note that no severe confirmation regarding the relationship has been made to the public.</p><p>Nonetheless, the couple appears to be in a joyful connection and makes a beautiful pair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/modelfact.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/anthony-2.png><p>Likewise, Anthony’s girlfriend’s name is Mykie; she is a renowned makeup artist and YouTube personality.</p><p>Mykie occasionally shares pictures with her boyfriend, Padilla, on her social media account, Instagram.</p><p>The two of them together form a lovely and pleasing couple that catches the attention of others.</p><p>Many may not know this, but the actual name of the remarkable Padilla’s girlfriend is Lauren Mychal.</p><p>Furthermore, Mykie is also a makeup artist who regularly posts beauty and makeup tutorials on her youtube channel “Glam & Gore.”</p><p><span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family)>Nevertheless, on Anthony’s Instagram account, you’ll mostly find posts related to his work, with some feeds featuring his girlfriend, who is also an influencer.</span></p><p>As mentioned, Anthony appears to be in a blissful relationship with his current YouTuber girlfriend.</p><h2>Anthony Padilla Past Relationship&nbsp;</h2><p>Digging further into his past, it is said that in early 2015, he started dating writer and comedian Miel Bredouw.</p><p>However, he chose to keep their relationship even more private than the current one. While they did share some content online, it wasn’t that serious.</p><p>Signs of a potential breakup emerged in September 2019 when Miel relocated to New York, strongly suggesting that they had ended their relationship.</p><p>Furthermore, although there is limited information about them online, Padilla had previously been involved in other romantic relationships.</p><h2><strong>Anthony Padilla Parents And Ethnicity</strong></h2><p>Anthony comes from a family with exciting dynamics. His father, Dan Padilla, and his mother, Leezah Padilla, reportedly had him as an unplanned child.</p><p>Unfortunately, their relationship ended when Anthony was just two years old.</p><p>It seems worth mentioning that Padilla’s mother has been open about her struggles with agoraphobia, a fear of open or public places.</p><p>Moreover, when it comes to Anthony’s ethnicity, his father has a mixed heritage with Filipino roots.</p><p>Furthermore, it is believed that Anthony’s paternal grandmother originates from the Philippines.</p><p>There is little information available regarding Padilla’s family background. As stated earlier, the Youtuber’s father has mixed Filipino roots, so we can safely say he has Filipino ancestry.</p><p>Additionally, it is found somewhere on the internet that the charming internet star Padilla has half-brothers named Mathew Worrel and Brandon Worrel.</p><p>Although there is no available information about his stepfather’s name, it is known that there is a stepfather in the picture.</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>That Girl Brittany Joy Tiktok: Wikipedia Age And Net Worth 2023</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln5myrbLAnKtnm5%2BifKK606Gmp7Fdpa6ltculmGavmZuybrnAq6minZRixKq3yGanmqqVo8G0ecStn6ehk57Buns%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./beauty-fans-swear-superdrugs-4-29243162.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beauty fans swear Superdrug's 4 hydrating serum is 'best on the high street'">&larr;
