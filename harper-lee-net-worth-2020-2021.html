If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Harper Lee’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Nelle Harper Lee was born on 28th April 1926 in Monroeville, Alabama. Lee grew up in a small town like a tomboy. Her father was a lawyer and also a member of the Alabama state legislature. He was also running a local newspaper in partnership. Her mother rarely left the house as she had a mental illness. Some reports suggest she had bipolar disorder. Truman Capote was her childhood friend who wants to be a writer too.</p><p>In childhood, Lee was often seen protecting Truman as she was very tough. Her interest in English literature was developed in Lee when she was in high school. She joined all-female Huntingdon College in Montgomery after completing graduation in 1944. Lee only has focused on writing and studies, not like the other girls her age who have an interest in dating, make up, and fashion. She was associated with the glee club and the literary honor society.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 28 April 1926, Harper Lee was 90 years old. Her height was 1.58 m tall, and her weight was 55 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Lee became the editor of her school’s humor magazine, the Rammer Jammer, after showcasing her writing skills for the magazine. She also wrote for the college newspaper. She worked with Tay Hohoff, an editor, and while working with him, she got the idea of a manuscript set in a small Alabama town. Later she wrote her novel “To Kill a Mockingbird” on that idea.</p><p>Lee helped Capote in writing “In Cold Blood.” But Capote did not acknowledge her contribution after the publication of the book, which created a distance between the two. After 55 years of writing her first book, Lee published her second book, “Go Set a Watchman,” in 2015. The novel broke pre-sale records and went on to become a success.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>A well-known author Harper Lee got many awards for her books. She got the Pulitzer Prize for fiction for the book “To Kill a Mockingbird” in 1961. In 2007, she earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom and Quill Award for Audio Book for “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Her book released in 2015 “Go Set a Watchman” got her Goodreads Choice Awards Best Fiction.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Harper Lee in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Harper-Lee-Net-Worth.jpg><p>Until 2015, “To Kill a Mockingbird” was her only written book, which she had written in 1960. She did not have to write another book as she was getting a healthy amount of money for the book. She earned more than $3 million as royalty for the book per year. Her net worth at the time of her death was estimated at around $35 million as of July 2024.</p><p>On 29th February 2016, this famous author died while sleeping at the age of 89.
