He said he was being punished for supporting opposition protesters.</p><p>Before political reforms passed earlier this year made it easier to form political parties, A Just Russia was one of only seven officially registered parties and represented an alternative to the Communists and the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party.</p><p>Party chairman Nikolai Levichev said the party was strong and dismissed Monday’s news conference as a stunt to promote Rodina and a party called Russian Pensioners for Justice.</p><p>In a statement, Levichev said Zotov and Zhuravlyov had already de facto left A Just Russia.</p><p>Zhuravlyov was elected to the State Duma in December on the list of the ruling United Russia party, and Zotov was expelled for supporting Dmitry Medvedev’s candidacy for prime minister.</p><p>The defection of a small group of deputies including Zotov and Alexei Mitrofanov earlier this year gave pro-Kremlin parties a de facto constitutional majority — 300 seats — in the Duma.</p><p>A Just Russia currently has the third-largest party faction in the Duma, with 64 seats in the 450-seat body. United Russia controls 238 seats.</p><p>Alexei Makarkin, head of the Center for Political Technologies, said Monday’s split was the result of the Kremlin’s displeasure with A Just Russia’s links to the opposition movement.</p><p>But Pavel Salin, an independent political analyst, said the real problem was with the shrinking political clout of co-founder and leader Sergei Mironov.</p><p>In the presidential election in March, Mironov won just under 4 percent of the vote, a few months after his party picked up seats in Duma elections in December, when it took 13 percent of the vote.</p><p>Mironov, a former Federation Council speaker and once a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, stepped down as chairman of the party in April 2011.</p><p>Mironov protested the ouster of Gennady Gudkov from the Duma last month, calling it “unlawful revenge” and “a rude violation of the Constitution.”</p><p>But on Saturday, he called on members of his party to stop wearing the white ribbons that have become the symbol of the anti-Kremlin protest movement after a United Russia deputy disparaged Mironov and several of his party’s deputies by name in a Duma speech.</p><p>Party members should distance themselves from opposition protesters, whose large rallies have turned into a “political sect,” Mironov said.</p><p>Rodina’s departure could threaten A Just Russia’s regional offices, Salin said, adding that Monday’s split could also spur more deputies to follow Zotov and Mitrofanov by abandoning A Just Russia.</p><p>“Without the support of the Kremlin, or the neutrality of the Kremlin, A Just Russia is not viable,” Salin said by telephone on Monday.</p><p>A source within A Just Russia told The Moscow Times on Monday that the party’s survival depends on continued support from Putin.</p><p>“Mironov doesn’t have serious problems with Putin, but he is critical of the government and Medvedev,” the source said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.</p><p><b>Related articles</b>:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpqasm5%2Bswaq5xKxlnKedZH9xfZFoaGlnYm58onnJrqqtZaKqwLS1wGaroaqVlsGmusSdZJqrXZu8trrDoqWgZZenvLa80maqqaSZqXqnvs6mZKmZoqnGbq2QcXBubw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./aaron-phypers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aaron Phypers Net Worth | Wife &amp;amp; Biography">&larr;
