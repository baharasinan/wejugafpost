(His first scene was with JR and he was slightly more butch.) Dack had just come off of 'Paper Dolls', which wasn't the most masculine show. It's interesting to binge watch 'Dallas' and see the quickly changing hairstyles the characters have. Dack's hair in in this 2nd scene is blown out to within an inch of its life, he's sashaying around in tighter than tight jeans, and wearing a tan leather jacket. To say he would've been hot to trot in 1985 is an understatement!</p><p>BTW, can't find a clip of flouncing around Jenilee Harrison as his long-lost sister in the aforementioned scene, but here he is with requisite fag hag Leta Powell Drake not long after he joined the show.</p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Offsite Link</a><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 36</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 14, 2022 1:28 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>he was very handsome and sweet.

She made a good "straight woman" for that kind of movie.</p><p>The other obvious Duffy replacement was John Beck, who returned as presumed-dead Mark Graison and rekindled his affair with Pam.</p><p>I always thought Victoria Principal was right on the money with something she said in an interview a while after she left. She was asked if she ever regretted leaving Dallas, and she said she had been proud to be part of it for the first seven seasons (which would be through 1983-84), but after that, it had peaked and was just diminishing returns. That's how I felt too. The quality was declining even in the pre-dream season (the one with Donnie Reed as Miss Ellie), though the ratings weren't reflecting it yet. And the seasons after the dream season got progressively worse.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 30</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 13, 2022 6:16 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>Dack Rambo sounds like a deep space 9 character.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 32</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 13, 2022 6:30 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>Dack Rambo, not one of the best actors I've seen</p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Offsite Link</a><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 33</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 13, 2022 7:56 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>R26 Again a self hating miserable soul..
