Risa Heller, a crisis PR specialist, issued a statement on Butler's behalf that read, "I have long struggled with mental health issues and the ghosts of childhood abuse. In my 30s, I started drinking as I dealt with the heaviest depression of my life after our family experienced a miscarriage. None of this is intended to excuse my behavior, but I do want to give some context and share what was happening in my life around this time."</p><p>One of Win's accusers, a gender-fluid individual who was given the pseudonym Lily in the article, said that Butler sexually assaulted them a few weeks after meeting at a another band's concert in 2015. A few months later, "Pitchfork" reported that a fifth accuser had come forward, alleging that she had a three-year emotionally manipulative relationship with Win.</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>Butler has been nominated for 10 Grammys, winning Album of the Year for "The Suburbs" in 2011.
