Saturday Night Live announced&nbsp;that both the actors would be hosting the sketch comedy show starting next month, and Oscar will lead the 5 March episode.</span></p><p><span>Singer Charlie XCX will appear on the show as the musical guest in the episode, which will be Oscar's hosting debut show. She was supposed to perform on the show back in December, but her performance was canceled as the show scaled back due to the Covid-19 omicron variant. She had first appeared on the show back in 2014, so the episode of Oscar's hosting debut will be her comeback on the show.</span></p><p><span>Rosalia will be joining Kravitz's hosting debut show in SNL as the musical guest on 12 March.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net Worth Of Oscar Isaac</span></strong></h2><p><span>Oscar Isaac has an estimated <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of $10 million. He is one of the well-respected and dignified American actors, and reportedly, he was <a href=# rel=noopener>paid $130,000</a> for his role in The Nativity Story in 2006. However, there has been a record of his earning just $2000 for his role in All About the Benjamins in 2002.</span></p><p><span>His earnings have been increased throughout the years, and he was paid approximately $2 million in Star Wars: The Force Awakens for his role as Poe Dameron.</span></p><p><span>Oscar Isaac was born in 1979 in Guatemala City, Guatemala, and moved to Florida, US, when he was five years old with his family. He made his debut in a crime drama, Milltown, in the mid-90s and acted in mid-200s films like All About the Benjamins, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, and more.</span></p><p><span>His breakthrough role was in The Star Wars: The Force Awakens, X Men: The Apocalypse, Show Me a Hero, A Most Violent Year, Ex Machina, and more. Some of his films are Balibo, Che, Robin Hood, Drive, W.E, ten years, The Life Before Her Eyes, Body of Lies, Agora, and more.</span></p><p><span>He has won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Supporting Actor, A Golden Globe Award, and more. He is also a skilled musician and guitarist.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Oscar Isaac Married?</span></strong></h2><p><span>After their red carpet appearance at Venice Film Festival went viral for their tender moment, Oscar Isaac was involved in dating rumors with his costar of Scenes from a Marriage, Jessica Chastain. Jessica Chastain draped her left arm across Issac's shoulder, and he tenderly kissed her arm after glancing at her, and then she pulled him for an embrace.</span></p><p><span>Their intense chemistry on the red carpet captured over 8 million views on Twitter, and many fans shipped them together, but they were just good actors and are not actually dating each other. In fact, they both are committed to their own special person. Jessica Chastain is the wife of Passi de Preposulo, and Issac has a wife named Elvira Lind.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, Jessica Chastain explained the red carpet viral moment on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert and said that they have been friends for more than 20 years and said about a romantic relationship between them that if it hadn't happened till then, so it was not gonna happen.</span></p><p><span><strong>YOU MAY LIKE:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Jessica Chastain Having PDA Moment With Oscar Isaac| Insights About Her Net Worth & Dating Life</a></strong></span></p><p><span>Oscar Isaac made headlines when he referred to Pedro Pascal as his girlfriend back in 2021. When Oscar was asked about who'd he like to go to space with for the next time, he answered that he would like to go to space with his sweet girlfriend, Pedro, and said that he was his girl and they were two sisters. He also called Pedro his baby and claimed him his own. After that interview, Twitter users admired their bromance and friendship and asked to be joined with them.</span></p><p><span>Coming to his actual relationship, Oscar Issac has a beautiful wife, Elvira Lind, and they got married in 2017. The couple is parents to two children named Eugene and Mads. His wife, Elvira, is a Danish screenwriter and film Director.</span></p><p><span>They first met in 2013 when they worked for Inside Llewyn Davis and have been close since then. They became an official couple in public in 2016 and made their red carpet debut as a couple in Golden Globes and shared some PDA moments at the event.</span></p><p><span>However, before settling down with his wife, Elvira, Oscar was linked with actress Maria Miranda, and they were engaged in 2007. But Oscar is really private about his personal life, and he never uses social platforms. And their relationship was never confirmed by them, but some sources admitted it.
