Let’s explore her prior relationships in depth in addition to her current love life.</p><h2><span id=Is_Jessica_Serfaty_Single_Relationship_Boyfriend>Is Jessica Serfaty Single?

When she was 16 years old, she first met her ex-husband at the church group. She became pregnant while they were dating and gave birth to Roman Serfaty, their son, as their first child. In 2008, the pair rang the church’s wedding bells. But as she tried to balance her work and her family, she started to neglect the latter, and over time, her marriage started to break down.</p><p>The tangent level was used by the pair to try to make things easier, but it didn’t succeed, and they separated in 2013.</p><p>Jessica soon after began dating. India, a stay-at-home father, was upset and emerged from hiding to accuse Jessica of “abandoning” his seven-year-old kid to pursue her Hollywood ambitions.</p><p>India stated in a conversation:</p><p>“Roman Serfaty doesn’t see her as frequently as you’d want to know. She is in LA, while we are in Arkansas. She’s young, though. She probably isn’t considering us. When attempting to establish a Hollywood career, it might be difficult to stop thinking about oneself.”</p><p>Jessica defended herself by stating:</p><p>“I’ve offered him [Ididia] a few offers to go to California – I would pay for the move out and assist him for a few months until he got a job and got on his feet, but each time he’s stated he needs a bit longer,” the woman said.”</p><p>Jessica continued with her romantic life in this manner.</p><p>Nial Horan, a popular favorite, comes in first on the list after the disastrous marriage. The pair dazzled the crowd at the AMAs for the first time, both of them up for continuing the good times.</p><p>After the ceremony, Nial and his date were seen leaving in the car to continue their evening in Los Angeles.</p><p>However, their union did not endure long.</p><p>Second, she began dating DNCE’s lead singer Joe Jones. They flaunted their relationship during numerous outings and gigs. The excursion only lasted a few weeks.</p><p>Justin Bieber comes in third; the two were spotted dining at Hollywood hotspot “The Nice Guy.”</p><p>Partygoers who saw them remarked they appeared more like a couple! However, there was nothing significant; they were merely creating headlines on websites for celebrities.</p><p>One of her longest relationships was with the well-known content producer Logan Paul; the two were together for two full years, from 2014 to 2016, and there are rumors that they even shared a home at one time.</p><p>The two kept their relationship private from the media, so there isn’t a lot of information about them together.</p><p>Ed Westwick, sometimes known as Chuck Bass, was another well-known individual to appear on the list. At the BAFTAs, they both made their debut. She posted a photo to Instagram in May 2017 with the caption:</p><p>“Now that’s official. I’m in awe.”</p><p>But to further concentrate on each person’s work in 2018, the two decided to part ways.</p><p>Also Read, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Abilio James Acosta</a>, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Ladd Drummond</a>, and <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Ryans Williams</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Model</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Juanita Bynum Admits Her Sexuality After Her Marriage</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Roger Mooking, Unknown Information About Wife & Family</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfn7K0v8icmGarlaezosDYZpinnF2grqK6jKCsp5mpqHq0sc%2BaqZqsmaS7cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jessica-todd-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-123381-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jessica Todd Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
