Let's learn everything about him!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Niall on 'The Voice'?</h2><p>Back in 2010, Irish singer-songwriter Niall Horan got his own big break on another reality singing show — <a href=#>The X Factor</a>.</p><p>Niall auditioned as a solo act, but then he and four other lads (who had each auditioned as solo acts too) were put together as a group called One Direction.</p><p>Niall was actually the first solo competitor on The X Factor chosen to be in One Direction, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>.</p><p>Naturally, One Direction made it, and Niall found himself in a new role as a global singing sensation until the band broke up in 2016.</p><p>So did Niall release any solo albums or go on tour (or act in films with ridiculous amounts of <a href=#>behind-the-scenes drama</a> like his former bandmate <a href=#>Harry Styles</a>)? No to the latter, but yes to the former.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Niall has released three solo albums (so far).</h2><p>Niall didn't waste any time following One Direction's conscious uncoupling in 2016, signing as a solo artist with Capitol Records and releasing his first two solo albums, "Flicker" and "Heartbreak Weather" in 2017 and 2020 respectively.</p><p>The Voice Season 23 judge is still signed to Capitol Records, and announced on his social media channels that he'll be releasing his third solo album, "The Show," on June 9, 2023.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He's already released his first single from the album, a song titled "Heaven."</p><p>Fans can even pre-order "The Show" on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Niall's official website</a> now (but there's a limit of four copies per customer, just FYI!).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@niallhoran href=#>@niallhoran</a><p>I couldn’t possibly be more happy to tell you that my new album ‘The Show’ will be released on June 9th. You can pre-order it now from the link in my bio This album is a piece of work I’m so proud of and now it’s time to pass it over to you to go and make it your own. Thank you so much for being there for me all this time and I can’t wait to share the next couple of years of this new era with you. I’ve missed you all so much. It’s good to be back Welcome to ‘The Show’</p><a title="♬ Heaven - Niall Horan" href=#>♬ Heaven - Niall Horan</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Niall married?</h2><p>Niall isn't married at the moment, but he has been a dedicated boyfriend to his lady love Amelia Wooley since 2020, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> magazine.</p><p>Although Niall is still very much the public figure when it comes to his music career, when it comes to his personal life, Niall has kept details about his relationship with Amelia on the down-low, which is completely understandable.</p><p>Per the same People report, many fans theorized that Niall's latest single, "Heaven," was inspired by his relationship with Amelia, who has worked in different roles in the fashion industry. Beyond that, it's unknown if the couple have any plans to tie the knot (maybe after The Voice Season 23 wraps up?).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The future looks bright for Niall. Could acting be next? (Maybe in <a href=#>Don't Worry Darling 2</a> perhaps?)</p><p>We'll just have to wait and see about that unexplored aspect of Niall's career, but in the meantime, you can watch Niall judge his team of singing hopefuls on The Voice Season 23, which airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST and Tuesdays at 9 pm. EST on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKehkaG5brvNZquhnV2rvKqvxA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-queen-camilla-missed-pre-coronation-events-including-buckingham-palace-reception.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Queen Camilla missed pre-coronation events - including Buckingham Palace reception">&larr;
