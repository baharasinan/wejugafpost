During the outing, the expectant royal delivered a speech saying, "I see time and time again that there is so much to be gained from talking of mental health and taking the mental health of our children as seriously as we do their physical health. When we intervene early in life, we help avoid problems that are much more challenging to address in adulthood.” Photo: Karwai Tang/WireImage/JONATHAN BRADY/AFP/Getty Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9e06f107f9c0-gallery35-a.jpg> The Duchess of Cambridge was the lady in red for her first engagement of the day on January 17.
