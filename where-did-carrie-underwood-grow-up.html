Where did she grow up before finding fame?</p><p><strong>Carrie Underwood was born in Muskogee, Oklahoma on March 10, 1983. She grew up on her parents’ farm in Checotah a town in McIntosh County, also in Oklahoma. In her teens, she attended Checotah High School and then Northeastern State University, having abandoned her dreams of a career in music before auditioning for “American Idol”.</strong></p><p>For more on Carrie Underwood’s early life and her amazing success, read on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Growing Up</h2><p>Carrie Marie Underwood was <a href=# rel=noopener>born on March 10, 1983, in Muskogee, Oklahoma</a>, the daughter of <a href=# rel=noopener>Steve Underwood and his wife, Carole Shatswell</a>.</p><p>Steve and Carole lived on a farm in nearby Checotah, Oklahoma, with <a href=# rel=noopener>Steve working in a paper mill while Carole worked as an elementary school teacher</a>. The couple already had two daughters, Shanna and Stephanie, when Carrie was born.</p><p>Carrie grew up on her parents’ farm and discovered her love of singing at an early age, performing in local talent shows, and <a href=# rel=noopener>at the local church, First Free Will Baptist Church</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>High School and College</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Underwood attended Checotah High school</a>, where she played basketball and softball, was a cheerleader and an Honor Society member.</p><p>During her high school years, a local fan arranged for Underwood to <a href=# rel=noopener>visit Nashville for an audition with Capitol Records in 1996</a>. Her audition went well and Capitol Records were prepared to sign her but a change in management meant that the deal never materialized.</p><p>On reflection, Carrie believes it’s a good thing that this early brush with stardom didn’t amount to anything. She believes she wouldn’t have been ready for the spotlight, had she found fame in her teens.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Underwood graduated from high school in 2001</a> and decided not to pursue music as a career, accepting that she needed to be realistic about her prospects and focus on long term employment. To this end, she enrolled at Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, <a href=# rel=noopener>graduating in 2006 with a degree in communication, focusing on journalism</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>American Idol</h2><p>Despite accepting that the chances of ever finding success in music were slim, Underwood continued performing. During her time at NSU, she <a href=# rel=noopener>performed at the university’s country show</a>.</p><p>She attended a St Louis, Missouri audition for the fourth season of “American Idol”, performing “I Can’t Make You Love Me” by Bonnie Raitt.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Judge Simon Cowell endorsed Underwood throughout this time on the competition, first saying that he thought she would be one of the favorites to win, then later saying that <a href=# rel=noopener>he believed she would win and sell more records than the previous three winners</a>.</p><p>The swell of support for Underwood throughout the show saw her fans taking the name <a href=# rel=noopener>“Carrie’s Care Bears”</a> and their support saw her become the likeliest choice to win. Show staff members have said that Underwood <a href=# rel=noopener>won every week’s audience vote by a wide margin</a> and she was the eventual winner of the competition.</p><p>On winning “American Idol”, Underwood was awarded a recording contract, a Ford Mustang convertible, and access to a private jet for twelve months.</p><p>Underwood’s first single, “Inside Your Heaven”, <a href=# rel=noopener>debuted at number one in the Billboard chart</a>, becoming the first country artist in history to debut in the top spot of the chart.</p><p>She followed this success by releasing her debut album, “Some Hearts”, which immediately topped Billboard’s country albums chart and <a href=# rel=noopener>placed second on their top 200 albums chart</a>. In time, it became the <a href=# rel=noopener>best selling album of 2006 in the United States</a>, as well as the top-selling country album in both 2006 and 2007.</p><p>It remains the highest-selling album by any “American Idol” contestant and went on to be certified eight times platinum, selling <a href=# rel=noopener>more than nine million copies worldwide</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfnqqVYrGqsIycmKuqmZp6trrDnqmwp5%2BZeqi%2BzrBkrqhf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./john-abdo-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Sachzna Laparan Dating Now?
